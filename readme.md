# Roadmap

- publishable stubs
- make test command
- smart builds
    - maybe multithread?
    - maybe single changed page builds (if web.php changes, trigger full rebuild)
- assets helper
- mix() function to allow for asset versioning - need to grok mix-manifest.json
- copy public folder into build smartly
- inject page details when building, last edit time, path, etc
- hotreload when 
    - env files change
    - config files change, reload config
- eject to full laravel app (copy views, content, fe asset pipeline, etc)
- build netlify.toml files that include Route::redirects configured (https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#app)

# Scratchpad

# Builds vs Env

- builds can be anything
- envs will decide what env and/or config files to load and which post processors to run

# Redirect

```php
Route::redirect('/old', '/new', function() {
    // render an html template with a js redirect
})
```

# Base Kits

- Minimal, no app, no config, no etc
- Tailwind Blog
- Tailwind Docs
- Bootstrap Docs

# Fake http request to build pages

- spin up local php server with the document route being a fake index.php
- use http client to make request to page "/about"

# File based routing
- next.js

# Misc

- new application
- accept params
- setup collision
- configure container
- init default providers
    - event
    - log
